# Circle Keeper Dashboard - Setup Instructions

## Overview
This guide will help you set up the Circle Keeper Dashboard with Supabase integration for Haijoel Men's Salon.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- A Supabase account
- Basic knowledge of React and TypeScript

## Step 1: Supabase Project Setup

### 1.1 Create a New Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Choose your organization
5. Enter project details:
   - Name: `circle-keeper-dashboard`
   - Database Password: (generate a strong password)
   - Region: (choose closest to your users)

### 1.2 Get Project Credentials
1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to "Settings" > "API"
2. Copy the following values:
   - Project URL
   - anon/public key

### 1.3 Create Environment File
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Update with your Supabase credentials:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Step 2: Database Schema Setup

### 2.1 Run Database Schema
1. In Supabase dashboard, go to "SQL Editor"
2. Copy the contents of `database-schema.sql`
3. Paste and run the SQL script
4. This will create all tables, triggers, and policies

### 2.2 Enable Storage
1. Go to "Storage" in Supabase dashboard
2. Create a new bucket called `visit-photos`
3. Set it to public or configure RLS policies as needed

## Step 3: Application Setup

### 3.1 Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3.2 Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Step 4: Create Test Users

### 4.1 Admin User
1. Go to Supabase Auth > Users
2. Add a new user:
   - Email: `admin@haijoel.com`
   - Password: `admin123`
   - Confirm: Yes
3. After creation, note the User ID
4. In SQL Editor, run:
```sql
SELECT update_user_profile_role(
  'user_id_here',
  'admin'::user_role,
  'Admin User'
);
```

### 4.2 Hairstylist User
1. Add user with email: `stylist@haijoel.com`, password: `stylist123`
2. Run SQL to set role:
```sql
SELECT update_user_profile_role(
  'user_id_here',
  'hairstylist'::user_role,
  'Test Hairstylist'
);
```

### 4.3 Member User
1. Add user with email: `member@haijoel.com`, password: `member123`
2. Run SQL to set role:
```sql
SELECT update_user_profile_role(
  'user_id_here',
  'member'::user_role,
  'Test Member'
);
```

## Step 5: Configure Row Level Security (RLS)

The database schema already includes RLS policies, but verify they're working:

1. Test login with each user type
2. Verify role-based access works
3. Check that users can only see their own data
